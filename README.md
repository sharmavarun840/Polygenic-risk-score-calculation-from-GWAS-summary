# Polygenic-risk-score-calculation-from-GWAS-summary uisng PRSice
To calculate a polygenic risk score from GWAS summary data in R, you can use the "PRSice" package. Here is an example of how you can use this package to calculate a polygenic risk score:

# Install the PRSice package
install.packages("PRSice")

# Load the PRSice package
library(PRSice)

# Set the path to your GWAS summary data file
gwas_file <- "path/to/your/gwas/summary/data/file"

# Set the path to where you want to save the output file
output_file <- "path/to/output/file"

# Calculate the polygenic risk score using the GWAS summary data
PRSice(base=gwas_file, target=gwas_file, target.type="binary", prefix=output_file)


This will calculate the polygenic risk score using the GWAS summary data in the specified file and save the results to the specified output file. Note that this is just an example and you may need to adjust the code depending on the specific details of your data and analysis. For more information, please refer to the PRSice package documentation.
